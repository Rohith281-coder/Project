# Project
Covid-19 Impacts on Global Economy: Analysis using Python
This project analyzes the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy using real-world GDP data before and during Covid. The goal is to visualize and understand economic shifts through data analysis and interactive charts.

📁 Project Structure
Covid-19 Impacts on global economy Analysis using Python.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the full data analysis and visualization code.

expenses.csv: CSV file with country-wise GDP data before and during Covid-19 (assumed source dataset).

README.md: Project documentation (this file).

📊 Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing with pandas.

Comparative GDP analysis of countries before and during the pandemic.

Interactive bar charts and visualizations using Plotly.

Insights into how different countries' economies were affected.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Plotly

NumPy (optional)

📈 Visualizations
The notebook generates interactive bar charts comparing:

GDP per capita before Covid-19.

GDP per capita during Covid-19.

These visualizations help to identify which countries faced the most significant economic declines.

📦 Setup Instructions
Clone this repository or download the notebook file.

Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas plotly
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open Covid-19 Impacts on global economy Analysis using Python.ipynb and run all cells.

📁 Data
Make sure your dataset file (e.g., expenses.csv) is in the correct format and placed in the same directory as the notebook.

✅ Future Improvements
Add more economic indicators (e.g., unemployment rate, inflation).

Include region-based comparison (Asia, Europe, etc.).

Use machine learning to predict future impacts or recovery trends.
